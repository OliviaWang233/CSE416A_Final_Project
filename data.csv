The remaining set of projected trees becomes the treebank that will be used to train a new dependency parser â€” we conduct our experiments using a version of the Collins parser that has been adapted for dependency treebanks (Collins et al. 1999).
1, Two rule-based methods to convert dependency structure into phrase structure are presented by Covington [14] and Collins et al.
1, Covington [14] and Collins et al. [13] use three simple rules with the help of X-bar theory and convert the dependency structure into phrase structure.
1, The dependents in the method of Collins et al. [13] project only one level; hence, the dependents of a head are in the same level.
2, We used the two-letter tag method proposed by Collins et al. [11] to integrate a family of POS tags to a CPOS.
3, Previous work on treebank conversion primarily focuses on converting one grammar formalism of a treebank into another and then conducting a study on the converted treebank (Collins et al., 1999; Xia et al., 2008).
4, The coarse morphological tag provided by Czech two-letter coarse morphological tag, as described in (Collins et al., 1999), The first letter is the main POS (12 possible values), the second letter is either the morphological case field if the main POS displays case (i.e. for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numerals and prepositions; 7 possible values), or the detailed POS if it does not (22 possible values).
5, Dependency-based representations have become increasingly popular in syntactic parsing, especially for languages that exhibit free or flexible word order, such as Czech [7], Bulgarian [15], Turkish [14] and Russian [4].
6, For example, for constituent (phrase-structure) syntactic parsing [Charniak 2000; Collins 1999; Petrov et al. 2006] of Chinese, besides the most popular treebank, Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) [Xue et al. 2002], there are other treebanks such as Tsinghua Chinese Treebank (TCT) [Zhou 1996] and Peking Chinese Treebank.
6, Algorithm 2 presents the extended version of the decoding algorithm used in the Collins parser, what the algorithm needs to do is to generate edges for each span.
6, One type focuses on converting treebanks of different grammar formalisms. Collins et al. [1999] addressed constituent syntactic parsing on Czech using a treebank converted from a Prague dependency treebank.
7, Much work has been done on the use of morphological features for parsing of morphologically rich languages. Collins et al. (1999) report that an optimal tagset for parsing Czech consists of a basic POS tag plus a CASE feature (when applicable).
8, Subsequently, researchers have begun to look at both porting these parsers to new domains (Gildea, 2001; McClosky et al., 2006; Petrov et al., 2010) and constructing parsers for new languages (Collins et al., 1999; Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).
9, By comparison, the case feature improved parsing for Czech (Collins et al., 1999) and the combination of the number feature for adjectives and mode feature for verbs improved results for Spanish (Cowan and Collins, 2005).
10, For Czech, the adaptation by Collins et al. (1999) culminated in an 80 F1-score.
11, Much work has been done on the use of morphological features for parsing of morphologically rich languages. Collins et al. (1999) report that an optimal tagset for parsing Czech consists of a basic POS tag plus a CASE feature (when applicable).
12, For example, Collins et al. (1999) adapted Collins' parser to Czech, a highly- inflected language.
12, Since the early times of treebank-based parsing systems, a lot of effort has been devoted to aspects of preprocessing trees in order to improve the results (Collins, 1999).
12, Tree transformations have long been applied with the objective of improving parsing results (Collins, 1999; Nilsson et al., 2007).
13, Explanations for this phenomenon have included the relative informativeness of lexicalization (Dubey and Keller, 2003; Arun and Keller, 2005), insensitivity to morphology (Cowan and Collins, 2005; Tsarfaty and Sima'an, 2008), and the effect of variable word order (Collins et al., 1999).
14, There have been some work (Collins et al., 1999b; Xia and Palmer, 2001) about converting dependency structures to phrase structures.
14, Collins et al. (1999b) proposed an algorithm to convert the Czech dependency Treebank into a phrase structure Treebank and do dependency parsing through Collins (1999a)'s model.
14, Different from tree- transformed PCFG based approach and lexicalized PCFG based approach, both of Collins et al. (1999b) and Xia and Palmer (2001) attempted to build some heuristic rules through linguistic theory, but didn't try to learn anything from Treebank.
15, Collins et al. (1999) addressed constituent syntactic parsing on Czech using a treebank converted from a Prague dependency treebank, where conversion rules derived from head-dependent pairs and heuristic rules are applied.
16, Other related works focus on converting one grammar formalism of a treebank to another and then conducting studies on the converted treebank (Collins et al., 1999; Forst, 2003; Wang et al., 1994; Watkinson and Manandhar, 2001).
16, Previous methods for DS to PS conversion (Collins et al., 1999; Covington, 1994; Xia and Palmer, 2001; Xia et al., 2008) often rely on pre- defined heuristic rules to eliminate converison ambiguity, e.g., minimal projection for dependents, lowest attachment position for dependents, and the selection of conversion rules that add fewer number of nodes to the converted tree.
16, Previous DS to PS conversion methods built a converted tree by iteratively attaching nodes and edges to the tree with the help of conversion rules and heuristic rules, based on current head- dependent pair from a source dependency tree and the structure of the built tree (Collins et al., 1999; Covington, 1994; Xia and Palmer, 2001; Xia et al., 2008).
16, Collins et al. (1999) performed statistical constituency parsing of Czech on a treebank that was converted from the Prague Dependency Treebank under the guidance of conversion rules and heuristic rules, e.g., one level of projection for any category, minimal projection for any dependents, and fixed position of attachment.
17, In the application of the Collins parser to the Prague Dependency Treebank (Collins et al. 1999) the automatic mapping from dependency to phrase-structure was a major area of research.

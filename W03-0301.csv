the french/english data were those used by mihalcea and pedersen (2003). 
we trained and evaluated our various modifications to model 1 on data from the bilingual word alignment workshop held at hlt-naacl 2003 (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
the experiments reported here were carried out using data from the workshop on building and using parallel texts held at hlt-naacl 2003 (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
it was the basis for a system that performed very well in a comparison of several alignment systems (dejean et al, 2003; mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
this data set was used for the 2003 naacl shared task (mihalcea and ped-ersen, 2003), where the word-aligned sentences were split into a 37 sentencetrial set and a 447 sentence testing set. 
we use a similar graphical structure to the directed hidden markov model (hmm) from giza++ (och and ney, 2003). 
for parameter tuning, we used the 17 sentence trial set from the romanian-english corpus in the 2003 naacl task (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
we use the data provided for the french-english shared task of the 2003 hltnaacl workshop on building and using parallel texts (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
the evaluation is done using the performance measures described in (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003): precision, recall and f-score on the probable and sure alignments, as well as the alignment error rate (aer), which in our case is a weighted average of the recall on the sure alignments and the precision on the probable. 
we also compared the performance on the 447  test sentences to 1/ the intersection of the alignments produced by the top ibm4 alignments in either directions, and 2/ the best systems from (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
mihalcea and pedersen (2003) described a shared task where the goal was to achieve the best aer.
